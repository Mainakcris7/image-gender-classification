# Image Gender Classification Model

This project is a gender classification model designed to analyze images and predict the gender of individuals based on their facial features. It utilizes `Convolutional Neural Networks` (CNNs) to extract relevant features from the images and make accurate gender predictions.

## Key Features
1. **CNN Architecture:** The model is built using a deep Convolutional Neural Network, allowing it to learn hierarchical features from facial images.

2. **Gender Prediction:** Given an input image, the model can predict whether the person in the image is male or female.

3. **Test set:** `test` folder contains some images for testing purposes.

Feel free to use `gender_detector.keras` model without running the whole script for gender predictions.
